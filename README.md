## Text Animation using JavaScript
This is a simple and visually appealing Text Animation project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It animates text by fading in each character one after another, giving a smooth and elegant entrance effect.

## 🚀 Features
Animates each character individually using JavaScript.

Smooth fade-in and slide-in animation effect.

Fully responsive and works on all modern browsers.

Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no frameworks needed.

## 🛠️ How It Works
JavaScript takes the content of the heading and splits it into individual characters.

Each character is wrapped inside a <span>.

A setInterval() function progressively adds the fade class to each span.

CSS handles the transition effect to animate opacity and position.

## 💡 Ideas to Improve
Add hover or click-triggered animations.

Support for multiple lines or dynamic text.

Typing effect + fade-in hybrid.
